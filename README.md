How to use
1. Replace placeholder content (project links, images, and demo links) in `index.html`.
2. Optionally add a profile photo at `assets/profile.jpg` and replace the SVG in the hero with:
   `<img src="assets/profile.jpg" alt="Natnael Aklilu" class="avatar">`
3. Update `script.js` if you want contact messages handled by a backend or a form service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).
4. Commit files to the repository root (or to `docs/` if you prefer) and enable GitHub Pages.

Notes
- The contact form opens the user's mail client via `mailto:`; to collect messages on the server, integrate a form backend or a form service.
- The site is intentionally minimal to be easy to maintain and personalize.

Want me to push these files into your repository (natiake/natnaelaklilu.github.io)? Tell me whether to place them in the repository root or in a `docs/` folder and I can create a branch and commit the files for you.
